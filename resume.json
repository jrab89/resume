    "summary": "I've been interested in building software since I was in high school and have been doing so professionally since 2011. I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Iowa, where I also ended up with minors in Math and Computer Science. In school I was interested in microcontrollers and embedded systems, but since then I've mostly been writing server-side code. I enjoy reading about and experimenting with technology!",
